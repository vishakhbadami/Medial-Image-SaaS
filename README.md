# SaaS Application Documentation

## Introduction
This repository contains the codebase for a SaaS application built using Nuxt3.js and associated technologies. The application follows modern web development practices and utilizes a component-based architecture, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local system using the following command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vishakhbadami/Medial-Image-SaaS.git
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies with the following commands:
```bash
# Install primary dependencies
$ npm install

# Install Nuxt3-specific tools
$ npm install nuxi
```

### Development Server
Run the application locally with hot reloading:
```bash
$ npx nuxi dev
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript**: Provides strong typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **Nuxt3.js**: A robust framework for building Vue.js applications with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Naive UI**: A Vue 3-based UI library for pre-styled components.
- **Vue Composition API**: Enables a cleaner and more modular code structure.

## Directory Structure

### `assets`
Contains uncompiled assets like styles, images, and fonts. These are processed during build time.

### `components`
Reusable Vue components that form the building blocks of the application. These components can be used across pages and layouts.

### `layouts`
Templates for the overall structure of your application (e.g., header, footer, sidebars).

### `pages`
Defines the views and routes of the application. Each `.vue` file in this directory corresponds to a route.

### `plugins`
Custom JavaScript or Vue plugins, such as those for third-party libraries, are registered here.

### `static`
Contains static files like images or robots.txt, served directly without processing.

### `store`
Manages the application state using Vuex.

## Implementation Approach

### Thought Process
1. **Framework Selection**: Nuxt3.js was chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and seamless integration with Vue3.
2. **Componentization**: Designed a modular architecture to promote reusability.
3. **Styling**: Used Tailwind CSS to ensure rapid UI development and consistent design.

### Key Features Implemented
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the UI works on various screen sizes.
- **Scalable State Management**: Leveraged Vuex for efficient state handling.
- **SSR & SSG**: Configured Nuxt for optimized rendering strategies based on use cases.

## Assumptions and Challenges

### Assumptions
1. Users have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Vue.js.
2. The application will be deployed in environments that support Node.js.
3. External APIs (if used) are well-documented and reliable.

### Challenges
1. **State Management Complexity**: Deciding on the granularity of Vuex modules.
2. **Styling Consistency**: Adapting Tailwind CSS for custom design requirements.
3. **Server Rendering**: Handling asynchronous data fetching without performance degradation.

## Methodology

### Agile Development
- **Sprints**: Development was broken into manageable sprints to deliver incremental features.
- **Stand-ups**: Regular check-ins ensured alignment across team members.

### Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Each component was tested individually using Vue Test Utils.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensured smooth interaction between different modules.

### Deployment
- Configured CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
